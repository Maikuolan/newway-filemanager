Newway is a file manager for servers written on PHP.To install just download this repo and place the folder in the root and access by `https://yourwebsitename/foldername`, You will be asked to setup email, password to access file manager.This application doesnt require database, instead it uses a flat file as database which will be generated and placed outside your root directory after the completion of setup.Other things in this file manager are pretty self explantory

## Installation
Newway uses the presence of the `users.json` file to detect whether an email ID and password has been registered. If you forget the email ID or password registered for Newway, the only way to reset it is to delete the `users.json` file (thus deleting the existing registered information). After doing so, you'll be able to register a new email ID and password for Newway.
